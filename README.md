# Project 6: Countdown Timer Python Project

This is a simple Countdown Timer implemented in Python. The program allows users to input a time duration in seconds and starts a countdown. Once the countdown reaches zero, a notification will be displayed to alert the user that the timer has finished. It is an excellent project to understand basic programming concepts such as loops, time handling, and user input.

# Features
User Input: Allows users to input a time duration in seconds.
Countdown Display: The remaining time is displayed in real-time as the countdown progresses.
Completion Notification: Once the countdown reaches zero, the program notifies the user that the time is up.
Simple and Easy to Use: The interface is simple and only requires basic input, making it easy to use.

# Google Colab

Google Colab will be used by students to complete all assignments and projects
